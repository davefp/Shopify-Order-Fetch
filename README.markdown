Shopify Order Fetch
===================

Shopify offers its merchants the ability to export past orders in csv format via email. However, the periods you can export are limited to past months and quarters.

Shopify Order Fetch is a simple bookmarklet that allows greater flexibility by using custom to- and from-dates. In its current form it fetches orders from the previous calendar day, but this could be easily changed.
